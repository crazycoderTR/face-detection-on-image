# face-detection-on-image
## Face detection on image with JavaScript! 

I created a basic app for face detecting with jquery.facedetection library.
<br>
It take faces on the image which you selected.
<br>
Usually it doesn't work because there are some mistakes on the library!
It can't detect the faces. The reason for the library. Hopefully it will work in the future.

## Getting Started
You do not need anything just clone and use it but I have used Webstorm live server and you can use the same or you can use other live servers.
<br>
Like;
<br>
    1) Node.js Server <br>
    2) Php Server <br>
    3) VS Code live server <br>
        etc.
<br>

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/crazycoderTR/face-detection-on-image.git .
<br>
cd face-detection-on-image
<br>
npm install

<br>
And use it on local servers!
